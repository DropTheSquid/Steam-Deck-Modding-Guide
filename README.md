# Steam-Deck-Modding-Guide
A collection of modding guides for the Steam Deck

I have been successful modding several games on the Steam Deck which were definitely not intended to be modded on the Steam Deck (or at all, in some cases).
I figured I would collect my knowledge in a central place and allow others to contribute.

Things this will not cover:
Getting a game running at all. There are better places for this.
How to mod a game at all. This guide will assume some familiarity with modding a given game on Windows, and will cover the differences in the process for modding it on the Steam Deck and/or linux.


I will go into a few different specific games, but it is worth keeping in mind a few things, as lots of the process will generalize to most games. 
* Is there software required for modding, or is it manual file replacements? If there is software (usually a mod manager) you will need to run it in Wine/Proton and make sure it has access to what it needs.
* Do the mods only modify game install files, or also auxiliary files, for example, in the user profile, such as documents? If there is software and it touches files outside of the game install, you will most likely need to run that software in the same Wine prefix as the game.
